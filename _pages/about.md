Hi, I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in the College of Computer Science and Technology at Jilin University (JLU), under the supervision of Prof. [You Zhou](https://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1367/19089.htm). Previously, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), working with Senior Research Fellow [Di Wang](https://www.diwang.org/), with support from the China Scholarship Council (CSC). I received my B.Sc. from JLU in 2020, advised by Prof. [Chunguo Wu](https://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1367/19100.htm). 


I have published over ten papers in top-tier conferences and journals, including KDD, AAAI, TNNLS, TEVC, etc. You can find a full list of my [publications](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=euFhn8cAAAAJ&hl) and [CV](../assets/CV.pdf). Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaboration! 🤝🤝🤝

💡 Research Interests
======

My research interests lie in the emerging field of Learning to Optimize (L2Opt), with a particular focus on leveraging deep neural networks to solve challenging combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). I am also interested in exploring the automatic design of algorithms with the help of large language models (LLMs).
